The Real Time News, blockchain news project

The real time news project is blockchain based, real time, user generated information stream. 

Blockchain is a great mechanism for storing information; the news. A distributed blockchain is owned by everyone and noone. The nature of a blockchain as an unchangeable, immutable record makes it perfectly suited for storing historical and breaking information. Combining the the power of blockchain with a novel mechanism for validating and guaging the relative importance of incoming and past stories is at the core of this proposed project.

The basic idea is that people can braodcast headlnes to the system and those headlines join the chain if certain conditions are met. Once on the chain, stories can be linked to the headline which are in depth descriptions tied directly to headlines. Media can be tied to a headline in the same fashion and will by association also be related to the stories linked to the headlines. The unique feature of validity and amplitude voting would work in the same relatively simple fashion:

Validity and amplitude voting allow users to cast three types of vote. 

1) Verify

2) Falsify

3) amplify

These votes get tied to the headline ID, and can be queried by UIs to find the validty and relative importance of a story as voted by users.
